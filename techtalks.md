### Tech Talk 3: Sorts

- 4 types of sorts; Bubble, Insertion, Selection, and Merge
  - Bubble Sort
    - Iterate through dataset, comparing and switching 2 adjacent entries until full set is sorted
  - Insertion
    - Iterate through dataset, taking each entry and inserting it into the proper position in an output structure
  - Selection
    - Search through the dataset for the element belonging in the next position and put it at the beginning
  - Merge
    - Break down the original dataset and sort subsets, then merge subsets together for final list
- Run to find speed and big O complexity of each algorithm to find most efficient
  - Run sort on dataset of 5000 entries 12 times, find average time of middle 10


### Tech Talk 2: Calculator

- Using Reverse Polish Notation
  - 3 + 4 = 3 4 +
  - Need to create a way to read that and then parse inputs
  - Use stack to store 
    - Allows us to make sure everything goes in order, and helps with parsing RPN format
- Use hash map to define operators
  - Allows us to set precedence levels
  - Maintains order of operations
  - Also need separators for structure

### Tech Talk 1: Data Structures

- What are data structures?
  - Methods of organizing data
  - Include things such as arrays, lists, dictionaries, integers, floats, or even databases
- Data structures and algorithms
  - Data structures and algorithms intertwine and can be used together to create optimized and efficient code
- Programming Paradigms
  - Paradigm: approach/methodology when writing software
  - Python is an interpretive paradigm; very procedural and modular
  - Java is object oriented; has reusable strucutres and code - easy to use blueprint for code scaling
- Data Structures
  - In both interpretave and object oriented, common data structures are used to achieve success in code
  - Arrays/lists and dictionaries are used to hold multiple data values, with dictionaries having keys and values associated
