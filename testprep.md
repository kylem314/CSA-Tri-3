## Study Plan Overview

In order to best prepare for the upcoming AP exam, I’ll first use the practice tests in class and what I already know to find out which subjects I struggle the most with and need to study.  I’ll then watch the college board videos and take notes on them, with extra attention to the previously mentioned subjects.

Once I’ve finished taking notes on the videos, I’ll do extra practice tests and questions on top of the ones we do in class, found [here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions).  This will reinforce the learning and allow me to find any other topics I need to look back over.

Finally, I'll retake old FRQs on units I feel more comfortable with to ensure I still know the material and try to incorporate things from other units.

## Week 1 

Day | Goal |
--- | --- |
Monday | Put together study plan, watch AP daily video
Tuesday | Take MC test in class, begin taking notes on most confusing units, watch AP daily
Wednesday | Review MC test (test corrections on questions I'm confused about), watch AP daily
Thursday | Take FRQ test in class, finish taking notes on anything I'm struggling with, watch AP daily
Friday | Review FRQ test (notes on learnings and what I could do better), watch AP daily
Weekend | Review all notes and use practice FRQs over the weekend to study

## Test Review

### MCQ 2015
- Overall Score
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55672662/164757138-34bbdc4e-88de-412d-ac10-9f3e0ae33fd3.png)
  - I finished all the questions except for 27 which I skipped and didn't have time to go back to, so out of the questions I completed, I scored 35/38
- Missed Questions: 31, 35, 37
  - Question 31
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55672662/164757518-1520d131-074a-4d33-952e-224c9b32fc79.png)
    - I answered B, though the answer was E
    - Looking at the code, I thought it would just be a checkerboard pattern with X's at 0,1 and 1,0 and then down the board
    - However, the pattern stops at the 0,4 and 4,0 diagonal since the code doesn't reach the bottom right corner of the board due to the col++ and row--
  - Question 35
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55672662/164757918-5fe9803d-5a5e-47de-864e-2e2d9899f2aa.png)
    - I answered D, though the answer was C
    - Because the code is calculating midpoints and then looking for the target from there, the first index of target found is 6, not 5
    - I thought it would just find the first instance of the target number, so I didn't look at the order in which code was executed
  - Question 37
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55672662/164758255-c8c58b65-69be-46da-98b4-0b0aae8de5c7.png)

    - I answered D (I and II), though the answer was E (II and III)
    - Option I doesn't work, since it would add things to the result in the wrong order
    - Option III works and would return the proper string upon executing code
